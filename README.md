Hello everyone, this is just a very small todo app written in Rust.

There are limited thing you can do with this simple todo list.

You can:

    * add -- multiple items
    * complete -- muiltiple items (with a satisfying strikethrough)
    * delete -- multiple items
    * uncomplete -- can un-strikethrough an item (so unsatisfying)
    * list -- all items
    * update -- the name of one item in the list to another name
    * clear -- reset the whole file
