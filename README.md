Hello everyone, this is just a very small todo-cli app.

There are limited thing you can do with this simple todo list.
Here you can:
    - add -- multiple items
    - complete -- muiltiple items (with a satisfying strikethrough)
    - delete -- multiple items
    - list -- all items
    - update -- the name of one item in the list to another name
    - clear -- reset the whole file
